# Asteroids using Python and Pygame

This repo contains a clone of the classic **Asteroids** game, built as an exercise to practice **Pygame** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

## Why Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Matters
OOP helps in structuring code by organizing it into **classes and objects**, making it:
- **Modular** – Easier to manage and scale.
- **Reusable** – Code can be reused across different parts of the project.
- **Maintainable** – Reduces redundancy and improves debugging.

## Why Learn to Use Libraries & Virtual Environments?
- **Libraries like Pygame** provide powerful tools for game development, handling graphics, sound, and input.
- **Virtual Environments (`venv`)** help manage dependencies, ensuring your project runs on the correct versions of installed libraries without conflicts.
